# 🎮 Racing Game - Recent Enhancements

## ✅ Implemented Features

### 1. Car Sprites
- **Created sprite generator** (`create_sprites.py`) that generates detailed car images
- **5 different car types** with proper visual details (wheels, windows, headlights)
- **Transparent backgrounds** for clean rendering
- **Updated settings** to use sprite files instead of simple rectangles

### 2. Proper Car Orientation
- **Cars start facing up** (270° in pygame coordinates) 
- **Starting angle preserved** for proper reset behavior
- **Visual rotation** matches movement direction perfectly
- **Consistent orientation** across all car resets

### 3. Reverse Functionality
- **Full reverse capability** with S/↓ keys when stationary or slow
- **Proper reverse steering** (inverted controls when backing up)
- **Speed limitation** (50% of forward speed when reversing)
- **Visual indicators** (white reverse lights appear when backing up)
- **Smart brake/reverse logic** (brake when moving forward, reverse when stopped)

### 4. Improved Wall Collision System
- **Reduced stickiness** - cars no longer get stuck to walls
- **Angle-based collision** response with realistic physics
- **Wall sliding** - cars slide along walls instead of stopping
- **Adjustable stickiness** setting (O/L keys) from 0.0 to 1.0
- **Better collision recovery** with intelligent safe position finding
- **Reflection physics** for more realistic wall bouncing

### 5. Enhanced User Interface
- **Reverse status indicators** on screen for both players
- **Wall stickiness display** with real-time adjustment feedback
- **Updated control instructions** showing reverse functionality
- **Color-coded status** (red for reverse, green for settings, yellow for stats)

### 6. Global Settings System
- **Runtime adjustable settings** via `game_settings.py`
- **Global stickiness control** affecting both players
- **Real-time feedback** when adjusting settings
- **Persistent settings** during gameplay session

## 🎯 Key Improvements

### Collision Physics
- **Before**: Cars would reset to start when hitting walls
- **After**: Cars slow down and slide along walls realistically

### Car Control
- **Before**: Only forward movement and basic turning
- **After**: Full forward/reverse with proper steering mechanics

### Visual Feedback
- **Before**: Simple colored rectangles
- **After**: Detailed sprites with reverse lights and proper rotation

### Customization
- **Before**: Fixed collision behavior
- **After**: Adjustable wall stickiness and multiple physics settings

## 🚀 How to Use New Features

### Playing the Game
1. **Forward**: W/↑ accelerates forward
2. **Reverse**: S/↓ brakes then reverses when stopped
3. **Turning**: A,D/←,→ (reverses when backing up)
4. **Watch for**: White lights indicating reverse gear

### Adjusting Settings
- **O/L**: Increase/decrease wall stickiness (0.0 = no stick, 1.0 = very sticky)
- **U/J**: Adjust Player 1 turn speed
- **I/K**: Adjust Player 1 acceleration
- **Settings persist** for the gameplay session

### VS Code Integration
- **New task**: "🚗 Create Car Sprites" 
- **Debug config**: "🎨 Debug Sprite Creator"
- **All features** accessible through VS Code interface

The game now feels much more realistic with proper reverse functionality, less sticky wall collisions, and cars that face the right direction from the start!
