# Web Deployment Guide - SOLUTION FOUND! 🎉

## ✅ WORKING SOLUTION

The racing game web deployment is **fully functional** using Pygbag's built-in server!

### 🎮 How to Test the Game (WORKING METHOD)

#### Option 1: Pygbag Server (Recommended - WORKS!)
```bash
python build_web.py serve
```
This builds and serves the game with Pygbag's server on http://localhost:8080

#### Option 2: Build Archive for Deployment
```bash
python build_web.py archive
```
This creates `build/web.zip` for deployment to platforms like itch.io

## 🔧 Why This Works

The CORS issue was resolved by using **Pygbag's built-in server** instead of custom HTTP servers. Pygbag's server:

1. ✅ Properly handles CDN dependencies
2. ✅ Sets correct MIME types for WebAssembly
3. ✅ Manages CORS headers for cross-origin requests
4. ✅ Serves files with the right configuration for web games

## 🚀 Deployment Options

### For Testing & Development
Use Pygbag's server: `python build_web.py serve`

### For Production Deployment
1. **Game Platforms**: Use `build/web.zip` for itch.io, GameJolt, etc.
2. **Web Hosting**: Upload `build/web/` contents to any web host
3. **GitHub Pages**: Push `build/web/` contents to gh-pages branch

## 📊 Final Status

✅ **CLI Interface**: Complete with real-time settings adjustment
✅ **Web Deployment**: Working with Pygbag's built-in server  
✅ **Cross-Platform**: Dual-mode system (local Python + web browser)
✅ **Physics**: Realistic friction implementation
✅ **Build System**: Automated with proper dependency handling
✅ **CORS Issues**: Resolved using Pygbag's server

The racing game is now **production-ready** for both local and web deployment! 🏎️✨
