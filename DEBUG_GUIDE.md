# 🔍 Web Game Debugging Guide

## ✅ IMPORTANT: 404 Errors Are Normal!

The 404 errors you see in the browser console are **completely expected** and do not prevent the game from working:

- `pythonrc.py` - Optional file that may not exist in CDN
- `.map` files - Source maps for debugging (not essential)
- `devtools.json` - Browser development tools (not needed)

**These 404s do not break the game!**

## 🎮 What You Should Actually See

### Phase 1: Loading (First 5-10 seconds)
- Browser console shows: "Loading race from race.apk"
- May see Python loading messages
- Dark/black canvas area appears

### Phase 2: Game Running
- Racing game interface appears in the canvas
- Two cars visible on the track
- Game responds to keyboard input

## 🔧 Real Troubleshooting Steps

If the game doesn't appear **after loading**, try:

1. **Check the browser console for Python errors** (not 404s)
2. **Look for any red error messages** about the actual game code
3. **Wait 10-15 seconds** for loading to complete
4. **Try refreshing the page** once

## 🌐 Current Servers

- **Minimal Test**: http://localhost:8081 (simple bouncing ball)
- **Racing Game**: http://localhost:8080 (full game - restart if needed)

## ✅ Success Indicators

**Game is working if you see:**
- Loading messages complete
- Canvas/game area appears
- Game graphics render (cars, track, etc.)

**Game has issues if:**
- Python runtime errors appear (not 404s)
- Canvas stays blank after 15+ seconds
- No loading messages appear at all

## 🚀 Quick Test

The minimal test at http://localhost:8081 should show:
- "TEST GAME WORKING!" text
- Red bouncing circle
- Green rectangle

If that works, Pygbag is fine and it's a game-specific issue.
